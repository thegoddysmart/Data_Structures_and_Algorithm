# Assignment 2 Analysis

## Task 1: Mystery Sort

### Random List Results

Below is the table of results from running the mystery sort on random lists of various sizes:

| List Size | Number of Comps | Number of Moves |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
|           |                 |                 |
|           |                 |                 |
|           |                 |                 |

*Insert your analysis of the experimental results here.*

### Almost-Sorted List Results

Below is the table of results from running the mystery sort on almost-sorted lists of various sizes:

| List Size | Number of Comps | Number of Moves |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
|           |                 |                 |
|           |                 |                 |
|           |                 |                 |
