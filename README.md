# Data Structures and Algorithms Review

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Review repository! I am taking it upon myself to learn and understand data structures and algorithm. This repository is dedicated to documenting and reviewing various data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.


## Folder Structure
The repository is organized into the following folders:

- `code/`: Contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in different programming languages.

- `notes/`: Contains markdown files with detailed explanations, study notes, and summaries of key concepts.

- `resources/`: Contains additional resources such as PDFs, links to tutorials, or reference materials.
