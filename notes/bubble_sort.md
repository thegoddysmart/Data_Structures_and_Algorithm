# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

### Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Bubble Sort works:

1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare the first two elements of the list. If they are out of order (i.e., the first element is greater than the second), swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the comparison and swap process.
4. Continue this process until you reach the end of the list. By the end of the first pass, the largest element will have "bubbled up" to the end of the list.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for the remaining elements of the list (excluding the elements that have already been sorted in previous passes).
6. Continue this process until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

```
Bubble Sort is called "Bubble" sort because with each pass, the larger elements gradually "bubble" to the top of the list.
